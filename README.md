# Departure board
A minimalistic web-based departure board with an overview of upcoming scheduled departures from a selected station in Greater Berlin Area. This is a test project to acquaint myself with Vue.js and state-of-the-art Javascript best practices.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
